# Connect 6

The game was developed as a result of a programming exam at the end of my first semester. On the one hand, one can play the classic board game as introduced in 2005 at the conference *Advances in Computer Games*. On the other hand, a *torus* variant of the game has been implemented, which allows results beyond the game board ends.

## Playmaking and Rules

The game is for two to four players who compete against each other. The players place in each valid turn two of their tokens marked *P1*, *P2*, *P3* and *P4* on the quadratic *N x N* board. On each free field only one token is allowed. The amount of tokens for the players are not limited. The first player, who has placed at least six of his tokens in a continuously horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, wins the game.

In a standard game board, the board edges are completed, so no placement outside the board is allowed and thus marked as invalid. In a torus game board, the outermost fields are neighbours to their opposite outermost fields, thus the edges are open. When a player tries to put his token outside the board at the field with row number *i* and column number *j*, the token will automatically placed on the field *i % N* and *j % N*.

To start the game, one will need three important command line arguments. As aforementioned, the first one is the board type. Secondly, the amount of rows or columns is selected. These need to fulfill the requirement of *17 < N < 21* and *N* needs to be even. In this version, only field sizes of *18 x 18* and *20 x 20* are implemented. The last one is the amount of players participating in the game. This could be 2, 3 or 4 players. All of the given arguments have to be seperated by whitespaces.

### Initialization

Standard game board:
`
java edu.kit.informatik.Main standard 20 2
`

Torus game board:
`
java edu.kit.informatik.Main torus 20 2
`

## Commands

To play this game via command line, you can use the following commands. Note that *<>* is used in the following examples to clarify the format of the command. These characters aren't used while playing.

### place

The place command always places two tokens of the active player on a free field of the game board.

```bash
place <row number 1>;<column number 1>;<row number 2>;<column number 2>
```

### rowprint

The rowprint command returns a certain row of the game board.

```bash
rowprint <row number>
```

### colprint

The colprint command returns a certain column of the game board.

```bash
colprint <column number>
```

### print

The print command returns the current game board with the given token placements.

```bash
print
```

### state

The state command returns the current state of a field on the game board.

```bash
state <row number>;<column number>
```

### reset

The reset command resets the game board of the given type and player 1 starts placing tokens.

```bash
reset
```

### quit

The quit command exits the program

```bash
quit
```

## Interaction

An example of an interaction in a standard game board. The *>* character with a following whitespace is used to clarify the user input.

```bash
> place 6;3;6;8
OK
> place 3;2;1;7
OK
> place 6;4;6;7
OK
> reset
OK
> place 6;3;6;8
OK
> place 3;2;1;7
OK
> place 6;4;6;7
OK
> place 6;9;6;2
OK
> place 6;5;6;6
P1 wins
> rowprint 6
** ** P2 P1 P1 P1 P1 P1 P1 P2 ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
> quit
```
